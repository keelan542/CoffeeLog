# CoffeeLog
An android app that allows users to keep a log of coffee they brew; method, ratio, extraction and time.
This project demonstrates using the Room library to store data, and displaying this data using the RecyclerView with custom adapter pattern. LiveData, ViewModel, and Room are a subset of the Android Architecture Components. The app can be found on the Play Store, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keelanbyrne.keelan542.coffeelog">here</a>.
